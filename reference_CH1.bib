Workers search both off- and on-the-job, giving rise to a job ladder, where employed workers slowly move toward more productive and better paying jobs through job-to-job transitions, while negative shocks occasionally throw them back into unemployment. The state of the economy includes the distribution of workers over wealth, labor earnings and match productivities. In the wake of an adverse financial shock calibrated to mimic the US Great Recession unemployment dynamics, firms reduce hiring, causing the job ladder to all but ``stop working.'' This leaves wages stagnant for several years, triggering a sharp contraction and slow recovery in consumption and output. On the supply side, the slow pace in worker turnover leaves workers stuck at the bottom of the ladder, effectively cutting labor productivity growth in the aggregate. The interaction between weak demand and low productivity leads to inflation dynamics that resemble the missing disinflation of that period.},

The response is even smaller in recessions, when earnings losses are larger and additional insurance is valuable. Using cross-state differences in transfer generosity, I find that generous transfers substantially crowd out the spousal earnings response. To study its policy implications, I develop an incomplete markets model with family labor supply and aggregate fluctuations, where predicted labor supply elasticities to taxes and transfers are in line with empirical estimates both in aggregate and across income groups. Counterfactual experiments indeed reveal that generous transfers in recessions discourage spousal earnings. I show that the optimal policy features procyclical means-tested and countercyclical employment-tested transfers, unlike the existing policy that maintains generous transfers of both types in recessions. Abstracting from the incentive costs of transfers on the spousal labor supply changes both the level and the cyclicality of optimal transfers.},

@article{Bloom2009,
	abstract = {Uncertainty appears to jump up after major shocks like the Cuban Missile crisis, the assassination of JFK, the OPEC I oil-price shock, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This paper offers a structural framework to analyze the impact of these uncertainty shocks. I build a model with a time-varying second moment, which is numerically solved and estimated using firm-level data. The parameterized model is then used to simulate a macro uncertainty shock, which produces a rapid drop and rebound in aggregate output and employment. This occurs because higher uncertainty causes firms to temporarily pause their investment and hiring. Productivity growth also falls because this pause in activity freezes reallocation across units. In the medium term the increased volatility from the shock induces an overshoot in output, employment, and productivity. Thus, uncertainty shocks generate short sharp recessions and recoveries. This simulated impact of an uncertainty shock is compared to vector autoregression estimations on actual data, showing a good match in both magnitude and timing. The paper also jointly estimates labor and capital adjustment costs (both convex and nonconvex). Ignoring capital adjustment costs is shown to lead to substantial bias, while ignoring labor adjustment costs does not.},

The measures are used to characterize the skill portfolio of each job and to construct distance measures between jobs. Wage losses in the Displaced Worker Surveys are shown to be more closely associated with switching skill portfolios than switching industry or occupation code per se. These switches represent large decreases in the skill portfolio in the postdisplacement job. The recent evidence for industry‐specific capital is reexamined. The results suggest a difference between fluid and crystallized skills. }

In sharp contrast to leading New Keynesian models, we do not impose wage inertia. Instead we derive wage inertia from our specification of how firms and workers negotiate wages. Our model outperforms a variant of the standard New Keynesian Calvo sticky wage model. According to our estimated model, there is a critical interaction between the degree of price stickiness, monetary policy, and the duration of an increase in unemployment benefits.},

	abstract = {We develop new evidence on the cumulative earnings losses associated with job displacement, drawing on longitudinal Social Security records from 1974 to 2008. In present-value terms, men lose an average of 1.4 years of predisplacement earnings if displaced in mass-layoff events that occur when the national unemployment rate is below 6 percent. They lose a staggering 2.8 years of predisplacement earnings if displaced when the unemployment rate exceeds 8 percent. These results reflect discounting at a 5 percent annual rate over 20 years after displacement. We also document large cyclical movements in the incidence of job loss and job displacement and present evidence on how worker anxieties about job loss, wage cuts, and job opportunities respond to contemporaneous economic conditions. Finally, we confront leading models of unemployment fluctuations with evidence on the present-value earnings losses associated with job displacement. The 1994 model of Dale Mortensen and Christopher Pissarides, extended to include search on the job, generates present-value losses that are only one-fourth as large as observed losses. Moreover, present-value losses in the model vary little with aggregate conditions at the time of displacement, unlike the pattern in the data.},

Cyclical fluctuations in the job-destruction rate magnify the output effects of shocks, as well as making them much more persistent. Interactions between capital adjustment and the job-destruction rate play an important role in generating persistence. Propagation effects are shown to be quantitatively substantial when the model is calibrated using job-flow data. incorporating costly capital adjustment leads to significantly greater propagation.},

	abstract = {We use sizable lottery prizes in Norwegian administrative panel data to explore how transitory income shocks are spent and saved over time and how households' marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) vary with household characteristics and shock size. We find that spending peaks in the year of winning and gradually reverts to normal within five years. Controlling for all items on households' balance sheets and characteristics such as education and income, it is the amount won, age, and liquid assets that vary systematically with MPCs. Low-liquidity winners of the smallest prizes (around US$1,500) are estimated to spend all within the year of winning. The corresponding estimate for high-liquidity winners of large prizes (US$8,300--150,000) is slightly below one-half. While conventional models will struggle to account for such high MPC levels, we show that a two-asset life cycle model with a realistic earnings profile and a luxury bequest motive can account for both the time profile of consumption responses and their systematic covariation with observables.},

	abstract = {We revisit the role of temporary layoffs in the business cycle, motivated by their unprecedented surge during the pandemic recession. We first measure the contribution of temporary layoffs to unemployment dynamics over the period 1979 to the present. While many have emphasized a stabilizing effect due to recall hiring, we quantify an important destabilizing effect due to ``loss-of-recall'', whereby workers in temporary-layoff unemployment lose their job permanently and do so at higher rates in recessions. We then develop a quantitative model that allows for endogenous flows of workers across employment and both temporary-layoff and jobless unemployment. The model captures well pre-pandemic unemployment dynamics and shows how loss-of-recall enhances the recessionary contribution of temporary layoffs. We also show that with some modification the model can capture the pandemic recession. We then use our structural model to show that the Paycheck Protection Program generated significant employment gains. It did so in part by significantly reducing loss-of-recall.},

               consumption mistakes (in response to saving changes) lead to
               higher current marginal propensities to consume (MPCs). These
               mistakes increase the value of changing current consumption
               relative to changing saving, as additional saving will not be
               spent optimally. Various behavioral biases can cause these
               mistakes, such as inattention, present bias, diagnostic
               expectations, and near-rationality (epsilon-mistakes). This
               result helps explain the empirical puzzle of high-liquidity
               consumers’ high MPCs. In my approach, predictions of
               sophistication (anticipation of future mistakes) can be derived
               independently of the underlying biases. (JEL D15, D91, E21)",

                  Leveraging random assignment from a tax lottery, we identify
                  large causal effects of the income windfall, tracking iMPCs
                  for eight months. Revealed-preference estimates from
                  expenditure data align with reported-preference survey results
                  for the same households, underscoring the validity of our data
                  and methods. We observe substantial heterogeneity in MPCs and
                  relate it to observable household characteristics. Households
                  report a higher MPC for unexpected income losses compared to
                  gains and prioritize debt repayment.",

  abstract	= {Abstract We investigate how households in temporarily
		  straitened circumstances due to an unemployment spell cut
		  back on expenditures and how they spend marginal dollars of
		  unemployment insurance (UI) benefit. Our theoretical and
		  empirical analyses emphasize the importance of allowing for
		  the fact that households buy durable as well as non-durable
		  goods. The theoretical analysis shows that in the short run
		  households can cut back significantly on total expenditures
		  without a significant fall in welfare if they concentrate
		  their budget reductions on durables. We then present an
		  empirical analysis based on a Canadian survey of workers
		  who experienced a job separation. Exploiting changes in the
		  unemployment insurance system over our sample period we
		  show that cuts in UI benefits lead to reductions in total
		  expenditure with a stronger impact on clothing than on food
		  expenditures. Our empirical strategy allows that these
		  expenditures may be non-separable from employment status.
		  The effects we find are particularly strong for households
		  with no liquid assets before the spell started. These
		  qualitative findings are in precise agreement with the
		  theoretical predictions. (JEL: D11, D12, D91, J65)},

  abstract	= {The goal of this chapter is to study how, and by how much,
		  household income, wealth, and preference heterogeneity
		  amplify and propagate a macroeconomic shock. We focus on
		  the US Great Recession of 2007–09 and proceed in two
		  steps. First, using data from the Panel Study of Income
		  Dynamics, we document the patterns of household income,
		  consumption, and wealth inequality before and during the
		  Great Recession. We then investigate how households in
		  different segments of the wealth distribution were affected
		  by income declines, and how they changed their expenditures
		  differentially during the aggregate downturn. Motivated by
		  this evidence, we study several variants of a standard
		  heterogeneous household model with aggregate shocks and an
		  endogenous cross-sectional wealth distribution. Our key
		  finding is that wealth inequality can significantly amplify
		  the impact of an aggregate shock, and it does so if the
		  distribution features a sufficiently large fraction of
		  households with very little net worth that sharply increase
		  their saving (ie, they are not hand-to mouth) as the
		  recession hits. We document that both these features are
		  observed in the PSID. We also investigate the role that
		  social insurance policies, such as unemployment insurance,
		  play in shaping the cross-sectional income and wealth
		  distribution, and through it, the dynamics of business
		  cycles.},

  abstract	= {We use sizable lottery prizes in Norwegian administrative
		  panel data to explore how transitory income shocks are
		  spent and saved over time and how households' marginal
		  propensities to consume (MPCs) vary with household
		  characteristics and shock size. We find that spending peaks
		  in the year of winning and gradually reverts to normal
		  within five years. Controlling for all items on households'
		  balance sheets and characteristics such as education and
		  income, it is the amount won, age, and liquid assets that
		  vary systematically with MPCs. Low-liquidity winners of the
		  smallest prizes (around US\$1,500) are estimated to spend
		  all within the year of winning. The corresponding estimate
		  for high-liquidity winners of large prizes
		  (US\$8,300–150,000) is slightly below one-half. While
		  conventional models will struggle to account for such high
		  MPC levels, we show that a two-asset life cycle model with
		  a realistic earnings profile and a luxury bequest motive
		  can account for both the time profile of consumption
		  responses and their systematic covariation with
		  observables.},

		  sheltered and exposed sector allowing us to model wage
		  bargaining between a labor union and the exposed sector,
		  reflecting Scandinavian wage formation institutions. Wages
		  are subject to a downward nominal wage rigidity (DNWR).
		  Inspired by many countries' fiscal policy responses to the
		  Great Recession and the coronavirus pandemic, we
		  investigate the model's ability to generate state-dependent
		  fiscal multipliers. We find, that both the zero lower bound
		  on nominal interest rates and DNWR individually can account
		  for higher fiscal multipliers during recessions. In joint
		  presence, however, the existence of DNWR reduces the
		  multiplier at the ZLB. Moreover, the DNWR significantly
		  relaxes the paradox of toil at the ZLB. We show that the
		  state-dependency is robust to alternative assumptions about
		  the origin of the recession, the nature of the fiscal
		  stimulus and its financing source.},
